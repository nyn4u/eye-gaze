# Notebook: Analysis & Visualizations

This is a markdown stub. For interactive analysis, convert to a Jupyter notebook and include plots:
- time-series plots of gaze_x and gaze_y
- highlighted ground-truth anomalies and detected CPD points
- model training curves for the NN classifier

Use matplotlib: `plt.plot(series)` and scatter detections.
